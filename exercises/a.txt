high Trees
Problem Statement:

There is a straight line which has N tree planted of different heights. Tree i has height h[i]. One day, the caretaker of the plantation became curious to know the maxium distance (j-i) between trees such that h[i]<=h[j].

Since the number of trees are huge and it's nearly impossible to solve this task manually, he came to you for help. He will provide an array of length N where ith element of array is height of tree i. Find the max(j-i) such that h[i]<=h[j] and also print i and j for such position. Both i and j should be in 0 based index.

It is guranteed that solution exists.
If there are multiple i and j, print the one with lower value of j.


Input Format:

First line contains an integer N<=100000
Second line contains N space separated integers where ith integer is height of tree i

Output Format:

First line contains max (j-i)
Second line contains 2 integers i and j


Sample Input 1:

4
3 1 4 2

Sample Output 1:

2
0 2

Explanation:

Possible pairs based on 0 based index are: (0,2), (1,3). Both have difference of 2 units hence ans is (0,2) since it has lower j.

Sample Input 2:

4
2 1 1 2

Sample Output 2:

3
0 3

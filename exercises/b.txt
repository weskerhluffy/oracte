Problem Statement:

World Cup is around the corner and all the teams are busy preparing for one of the biggest sports gathering in the world. World Cup management team is also working day and night to ensure a smooth tournament. We have a list of pair {i,j} of teams where i and j are the teams who will play their first match together in the tournament. There are 2*N teams numbered 0 to 2*N-1. Management wants to make this list good looking before world cup starts. A good looking list has team pairs like {0,1}, {2,3}, {4,5}, {6,7} ... {2*N-2, 2*N-1} only. Note that order doesn't matter, {0,1} and {1,0} are both valid good looking pair.

Given a list of team pairs, what is the minimum number of team swaps needed to make it a good looking list.


Input Format:

First line contains one integer 1<= N <= 10000, number of pairs.
Next N line contains 2 space separated integers representing a pair {i,j} in current list.

Output Format:

Print one integer, that is minimum number of swaps needed to make the list good looking

Sample Input 1:

3
1 3
0 2
4 5

Sample Output 1:

1

Explanation: 
If we swap 0 and 3, list becomes {1,0}, {3,2} and {4,5}. Which is a good looking list.

Sample Input 2:

2
3 2
0 1

Sample Output 2:

0

Explanation: List is already good looking.
